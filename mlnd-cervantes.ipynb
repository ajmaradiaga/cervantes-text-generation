    "\n",
    "[Deep Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning) is a new area of [Machine Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning), which has attracted a lot of attention lately due to the amazing results produced by Deep Learning models. With Deep Learning, it is now possible for an algorithm to predict things, classify images (objects) with great accuracy, detect fraudulent transactions, generate image, sound and text. These are tasks that were previously not possible to achieve by an algorithm and now perform better than a human.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we will focus on Text Generation. Text Generation is part of [Natural Language Processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing) and can be used to [transcribe speech to text](http://www.jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v32/graves14.pdf), perform [machine translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3215), generate handwritten text, image captioning, generate new blog posts or news headlines. \n",

    "RNNs are [very effective](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) when understanding sequence of elements and have been used in the past to generate text. I will use a Recurrent Neural Network to generate text inspired on the works of Cervantes.\n",

RNNs use an internal memory to process sequences of elements and is able to learn from the syntactic structure of text. Our model will be able to generate text based on the text we train it with."

    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "[Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miguel_de_Cervantes), was a Spanish writer who is regarded as the greater writer in Spanish language. Famous for his novel, [Don Quixote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Quixote), considered one of the best fiction novels ever written.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, Cervantes passed away 500 years ago and he will not be publishing new novels any time soon…. But, wouldn’t it be great if we could generate some text inspired on Don Quixote and other novels he published?\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve our problem, we can use text from novels written by Cervantes in combination with the incredible power of Deep Learning, in particular RNNs, to generate text. Our deep learning model will be trained on existing Cervantes works and will output new text, based on the internal representation of the text it was trained on, in the Neural Network.  \n",

    "![LSTM Cell](images/lstm_cell.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "LSTM Cell\n",
    "\n",
    "For our model to learn, we will use a special type of RNN called LSTMs (Long Short Term Memory), capable of learning long-term dependencies. LSTM can use its memory to generate complex, [realistic sequences](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1308.0850.pdf) containing long-range structure, just like the sentences that we want to generate. It will be able to remember information for a period of time, which will help at generating text of better quality. "

    "\n",
    "We can see that a learning rate of 0.01 is too large to train our Neural Network. When we trained it with 0.01, we were never able to achieve a train loss < 3. Another indicator of this is that the learning plateaus in both runs (0001, 0003); in *0001* it plateaus at around epoch 100 and in *0003* at around epoch 180.\n",
    "\n",
    "The training loss improved when we use a learning rate of 0.001. The lower learning rate improves our Neural network performance by -2.0. As the training is not plateauing, we are also able to train it longer. This is why we increase the epochs of run *0002* to 500.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sequence Length\n",
    "\n",
    "Our basic RNN was trained with a sequence length of 5. The sequence length, is the number of words to be included in every sequence.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We can see an improvement when increasing the sequence length to 10. This means that our RNN will use a longer sequence to train our Neural Network. Which ends up improving significantly the quality of text generated by our network. \n",
    "\n",
    "With a sequence length of 5, our text didn't made much sense, the sentences are short and the paragraphs are not well structured. \n",
    "\n",
    "When using a model trainer with sequence length of 10, we can notice that the text makes much more sense, and the quality of the sentences and paragraphs improves significantly. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Train some more\n",
    "\n",
    "Our best result in the the first 6 runs was run *0004*. If we train our network longer with the same parameters, we achieve a train loss of less than 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though our train loss for the last run is less than 1, we can see in the samples below that the text generated by *run 0004* and *run 0007* models are similar is several ways:\n",
    "- They are both able to open and close quotations\n",
    "- The text makes more sense when compared with *run 0001*, which is expected as the sequence length (10) used to train both models is longer than *run 0001* (5)\n",
    "- Paraghaps are well formed.\n",
    "- Sentence length is similar and close to the average sentence length.\n",

    "Text Samples:\n",

    "- Run 0004:\n",
